συγκινηθεί
από
τα
μηνύματά
σας
από
όλο
τον
κόσμο
σχετικά
με
την
προσφυγική
και
μεταναστευτική
κρίση
στην
Αφρική,
τη
Μέση
Ανατολή
και
την
Ευρώπη.
Αυτή
είναι
προφανώς
μια
εξαιρετικά
πολύπλοκη
και
θλιβερή
κατάσταση,
και
έχουμε
εργαστεί
σκληρά
κατά
τη
διάρκεια
των
τελευταίων
εβδομάδων
για
να
καθορίσουμε
πόσο
εμείς
&#8211;
ως
κοινότητα
–
μπορούμε
να
επιτύχουμε
καλύτερα
το
όραμά
μας
στις
δύσκολες
αυτές
στιγμές.
Η
προσέγγισή
μας
Στην
Airbnb,
παίρνουμε
πολύ
σοβαρά
την
εμπιστοσύνη
που
μας
δείχνει
η
κοινότητά
μας
ως
προς
την
ικανότητά
μας
να
ενεργοποιούμε
με
